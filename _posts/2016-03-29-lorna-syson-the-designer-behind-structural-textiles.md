Lorna
Syson, the designer behind Structural Textiles 

creates three dimensional textile installations
for interior spaces. Her high quality surface solutions are used for acoustic
panels, wall hangings, space dividers and screens. 

Lorna
will be exhibiting a number of pieces including her Bermondsey wall-hanging
made from 100% wool, a section of her wool felt veil from her commission at the
West London Buddhist centre and a compact version of her latest textile light
commissioned for a large, three story entrance space in San Francisco.

All of Lorna's structural textile designs are handmade and
have been tailored to the individual projects from conception to installation.
Each unique piece enhances its environment by adding warmth, texture and colour
as well as reducing noise.

Lorna's bespoke design service walks your
through the commissioning process to help you make clear decisions for your
projects. Her innovative designs strive to be eco-concious and sustainable, where
possible using 100% wool felt and recycled materials.
